# Hermod Schema
This repository is really simple, it defines a JSON Schema for Hermod config files.

Hermod files are actually written in YAML, but JSON Schema still works fine.

## Usage
First, download `schema.json` somewhere.

Then, make sure your IDE knows about it and can map it to `*.hermod.yaml` files.
